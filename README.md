# Dictionary
Implementation of web scraping using beautifulsoup (a module of python). Using this, a user can simply type in a word whose meaning they want to  find. The effort of googling and remembering the name of the website will now be suppressed.  


Right now the program has to be run manually and is working for those words only which have meanings. 
The other case will be handled soon. 

The full page is scraped and only major text is given as output. Will soon be updating.

cheers!
